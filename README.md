# The Los Pollos Hermanos API

> "I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!"

And this API is the one that *answers*.

Welcome to the digital distribution center for the Heisenberg empire. This Go API is the backbone of the **Heisenberg Stack**, serving up piping hot data on every character, quote, and shady connection from the world of Breaking Bad.

Our product is 99.1% pure data, cooked up with the finest ingredients:

- **The Cook**: Go & 
- **The Formula**: A SQLite database
- **The Intel**: Scraped directly from the source with beautifulSoup

## The Special Offer: "Six Degrees of Saul Goodman"

Ever wonder how Jesse Pinkman is connected to Lydia Rodarte-Quayle? Our star feature lets you find out. Using a sophisticated graph algorithm (BFS), we can calculate the shortest chain of connections between any two characters. No more guessingâ€”just pure, calculated chemistry.
